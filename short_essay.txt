With a background in materials engineering and some exposure to AI through a data science internship, I have seen firsthand the transformative impact AI can have on our world. I am eager to be a part of the industrial revolution by incorporating AI into various aspects of daily life. The potential to create diverse AI tools for different use cases excites me. I aspire to be a game changer in this technological era, making significant contributions to multiple industries and improving everyday life for many people.
